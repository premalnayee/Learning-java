# Learning-java
My first few projects into learning the monstrosity that is Java


The first project "Simple\_banking\_app as the name suggests is meant to be a simple banking app that allows the user to create a bank account, check their balance, withdraw and deposit money. The project was inspired from this blog post https://javahungry.blogspot.com/2019/12/java-projects-for-beginners.html, but my solution deviates from the given solution as I wanted to use as little help as possible as I believe that I will learn more that way. I asked my Java-experienced  buddy and using his advise I made some changes.
