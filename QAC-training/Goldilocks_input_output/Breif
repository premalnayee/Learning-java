Goldilocks’ Bear Necessities

Description

The task falls to you; given descriptions of Goldilocks' needs and of the available porridge/chairs at the dinner table, tell Goldilocks which chair to sit in, so the chair does not break, and the porridge is at an edible temperature.

Formal Input

The input begins with a line specifying Goldilocks' weight (as an integer in arbitrary weight-units) and the maximum temperature of porridge she will tolerate (again as an arbitrary-unit integer). This line is then followed by some number of lines, specifying a chair's weight capacity, and the temperature of the porridge in front of it.

Interpreting this, Goldilocks has a weight of 100 and a maximum porridge temperature of 80. The first seat at the table has a chair with a capacity of 30 and a portion of porridge with the temperature of 50. The second has a capacity of 130 and temperature of 60, etc.

Formal Output

The output must contain the numbers of the seats that Goldilocks can sit down at and eat up. This number counts up from 1 as the first seat.

Sample output:

2
5

Seats #2 and #5 have both good enough chairs to not collapse under Goldilocks, and porridge that is cool enough for her to eat.

Advanced
    • Model the porridge and chair as different objects
    • As well as Porridge and chair at each position, there is also now a light.
    • Each light has a luminosity, 0 – 100.
    • If the luminosity of a position is below 70, goldilocks cannot eat at this place.
