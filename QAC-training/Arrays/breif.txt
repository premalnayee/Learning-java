    1  Create an array that will hold 10 integer values, populate the array with values, then call and output each element.

    2  Create a for loop that populates an integer array with values, outputting them at each iteration. Then create another loop that iterates through the array, changing the values at each point to equal itself times 10, outputting them at each iteration.
